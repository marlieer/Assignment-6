# Welcome to Marlie's Page!

This is a page that gives a little glimpse as to how I see my future in computer science. I've also created a Hello World here.

I've just created a new branch that I will not delete. This line is the only change from the master

## My Career Prospects

There are plenty of careers available in computer science, which is the reason I study it. I'm looking for a career that can fit my lifestyle of working from home or the office and being flexible to pick kids up from school or drive them to sports practice. Computer science fit the bill on the dot, and as a bonus, I happen to like it.

**Here are some jobs in my community that have promising prospects**

- Tsilqotin National Government network and database management
- School Distrcit 27 IT Department

- Natural Resource Data Management and Analytics


# The Alternate

What I would really like to do is have my own start-up that specializes in database and application development and management for local companies.

Otherwise, I'd also _love_ to be a doctor, either specializing in cardiology or obstetrics and gynecology. Both computer science and medicine offer exciting careers of problem solving and important customer/client relatinoships.
